I copied and read through this file from the Kaggle competition learn tab

The file goes into great depths to analyse and understand what each column stands for from the feature point of view

       numeric                       /              non-numeric
discrete-continuous                             free text?   or  classified...

It also shows analysis of each type to geta feeling for what features are important
